# Tips

[Error handling](@ref)

## Debugging & Performance
- choose a coarse temporal resolution for debugging to speed up the process
- do not read in time-series data
- actually read the <a href="../error/#Error-handling">reporting file</a>
- check the list of common mistakes below
- if your model is infeasible and you use Gurobi try AnyMODs `printIIS(obj::anyModel)` function
- BarConvTool option
- obere grenze variable

## Workflow
- folders
- remember jump model can be expanded
- parameter data can be manipulated after read-in


## Common mistakes
(or at least mistakes that i believe to be common, because i tend to make them)
- input capacity
